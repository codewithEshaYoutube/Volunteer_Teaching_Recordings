# 🌍 Volunteer Teaching Recordings  
### *Empowering Underprivileged Students Through High-Quality Computer Science Education*

---

## Overview

This repository documents my volunteer initiative to advance **educational equity** by teaching high-quality computer science to **100+ underprivileged students**.

Through **iCodeGuru**, I designed and delivered a comprehensive **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** lecture series that combines:

- **Foundational theory explained simply**  
- **Hands-on LeetCode problem solving**  
- **Real-world algorithmic reasoning**  
- **Concept delivery in the students’ local language** to remove learning barriers  

This initiative reflects my commitment to making computer science **inclusive, rigorous, and empowering**, enabling students to build confidence, technical depth, and long-term career potential.
