# Volunteer_Teaching_Recordings

## Overview
Driven by a deep passion for **educational equity and empowerment**, this repository documents my volunteer teaching initiative designed to uplift **underprivileged students** through accessible computer science education.  

As part of **iCodeGuru**, I delivered a complete **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** lecture series, blending conceptual understanding with **LeetCode-style problem-solving**—taught in the students’ **local language** to remove learning barriers.  
Each session reflects my commitment to making technical education **inclusive, practical, and transformative** for learners with limited access to structured guidance.
